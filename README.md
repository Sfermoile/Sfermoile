About Me:

Hello! My name is Shawn Fermoile, a passionate and dedicated cybersecurity enthusiast with a focus on penetration testing, red teaming, and ethical hacking. My journey in the world of cybersecurity has led me to explore various tools, techniques, and methodologies essential for identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities. I am currently working towards achieving both the HTB Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS) and the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certifications, and I continually refine my skills through hands-on challenges and real-world scenarios.
